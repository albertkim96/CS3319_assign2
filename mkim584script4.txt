-- 1. Create a view that shows the customer first name and last name, the description of the products they have bought, the quantity of the products they have bought, the price of the product and a total cost to purchase that many items of each product. Order the view by the last name.
CREATE VIEW buy AS SELECT customers.fName, customers.lName, products.productDescription, purchase.quantity, products.costPerItem, products.costPerItem * purchase.quantity AS totalPrice FROM customers, products, purchase WHERE purchase.productID = products.productID and customers.customerID = purchase.customerID ORDER BY customers.lName;

-- 2. Prove that your view works by selecting all the rows from it. 
SELECT * FROM buy;

-- 3. Now select only the rows from the view (all columns from the view) where customers spent more than 100 dollars. 
SELECT * FROM buy WHERE totalPrice > 100;

-- 4. Delete the product that you made up using your product's description.
DELETE FROM products WHERE productDescription = 'iPhones';
-- 5. Prove that the delete worked.
SELECT * FROM products WHERE productDescription = 'iPhones';

-- 6. Delete all agents who are from Springfield.  
DELETE FROM agents WHERE city = 'Springfield';

-- The row where the city was Springfield, which belonged to the agent Hugh Grant, did not get deleted because ON DELETE is set to RESTRICT and any agents referenced by a row in customers cannot be deleted.
